## Abstract

This paper estimates the impact of monetary policy actions on bill, note, and bond yields, using data from the futures market for Federal funds to separate changes in the target funds rate into anticipated and unanticipated components. Interest rates' response to anticipated target rate changes is small, while their response to unanticipated changes is large and highly significant. These responses are generally consistent with the expectations hypothesis of the term structure. Surprise target rate changes have little effect on expectations of future actions, however, which helps to explain the lack of empirical support for the expectations hypothesis at the short end of the yield curve. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

## 1. Introduction

How market interest rates respond to Federal Reserve actions is a topic of great interest to financial market participants and policymakers alike. Bondholders, naturally, are concerned with the effects of Fed policy on bond prices. Since the first link in the transmission of Federal Reserve policy is from the Fed funds target to other interest rates, the issue is an important one for assessing the likely effectiveness of monetary policy.

Conventional wisdom is that an increase in the target Fed funds rate leads to an immediate increase in market interest rates, and a fall in bond prices; yet evidence for this view is elusive. Cook and Hahn (1989) documented a strong response in the 1970s, but regressions using data from the 1980s and 1990s show little, if any, impact of Fed policy on interest rates.

Using Fed funds futures rates to disentangle expected from unexpected policy actions, this paper shows that interest rates' response to the "surprise" component of Fed policy is significantly stronger than the response to the change in the target itself; in fact, rates' response to the anticipated component of policy actions is minimal, and consistent with the expectations hypothesis of the term structure.

## 2. A review of earlier studies

The first paper to assess markets' reaction to monetary policy actions is Cook and Hahn (1989), who examined the one-day response of bond rates to changes in the target Fed funds rate from 1974 through 1979. Their procedure was to regress the change in the bill, note and bond rates (denoted as \(R\)) on the change in the target Fed funds rate (denoted as \(\tilde{r}\)),

\[\Delta R_{t} = \alpha +\beta \Delta \tilde{r}_{t} + \epsilon_{t}, \quad (1)\]

for a sample consisting of 75 days on which the Fed changed the funds rate target.

Table 1 The 1-day response of interest rates to changes in the Fed funds target

| Maturity | Intercept | Response | R² | SE | DW |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 month | -3.6 | 26.8 | 0.42 | 9.8 | 2.04 |
| 6 month | -5.2 | 21.9 | 0.37 | 9.0 | 2.04 |
| 12 month | -5.1 | 19.8 | 0.29 | 9.5 | 2.07 |
| 2 year | -5.2 | 18.2 | 0.26 | 9.6 | 2.28 |
| 5 year | -4.5 | 10.4 | 0.10 | 9.8 | 2.40 |
| 10 year | -4.0 | 4.3 | 0.02 | 8.5 | 2.50 |
| 30 year | -3.6 | 0.1 | 0.00 | 6.9 | 2.47 |

Note: The change in the target Fed funds rate is expressed in percent, and the interest rate changes are expressed in basis points. The sample contains 42 changes in the target Fed funds rate from 6 June 1989 through 2 February 2000.

## Figures

**[Figure 2]** (scatter_plot, page 8)
> Two-panel scatter plot showing:
> - **Top panel**: Spot month futures rate minus cumulative average Fed funds rate, plotted against "days remaining" (x-axis from -30 to 0). Points converge toward zero as the month ends.
> - **Bottom panel**: Implied change in target Fed funds rate (basis points), same x-axis. Points show high volatility early in the month, settling as month-end approaches.
> 
> Formula shown: $f_{s,t}^0 - (1/t)\sum_{i=1}^{t}r_i$

**[Figure 3]** (scatter_plot, page 12)
> Scatter plot of futures rate changes versus actual Fed funds target changes. Shows strong positive correlation with most points clustered along the 45-degree line, indicating futures markets accurately predict Fed actions.
